      "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.peekapak.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peekapak</a> is a social-emotional learning company that creates curriculumns for teachers. A teacher is able to log in and open lesson plans that include story books, discussion questions, in-class assignments and home activities.<br /><br />My primary contribution to the company was implementing lessons for newly added grades. Previously the company provided curriculumns up to Grade 3, but had recently expanded to include Grades 4 and 5. Aside from creating and editing JSON files, the website had to be updated to allow teachers to create new classrooms and to view the new content.<br /><br />Once all available lessons were uploaded, I worked on the Publisher, which allows content-creaters to make the lessons without a developer. ~90% functionality was tested successfully and was able to upload majority of content.<br />Publisher functions include:<ul><li>Undo/Redo stack</li><li>Rich text editing</li><li>Creates and deletes sections of a list</li><li>Preview</li><li>Load content from database</li><li>Saves and publishes content to database</li><ul>"
